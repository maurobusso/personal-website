# Personal-website

How is it made?

I built it using npm create-react-app on VS Code and local server. 
I am particularly proud of this project because I have been planning it since the day I began learning to code, so having built it from the ground up was a major milestone for me.
I wanted something minimalist, well designed, and highly functional. 
I looked at dozens of portfolio websites, and while many of them were incredibly inspiring, I decided to keep things simple from the beginning.

What did I learn?

I learned that React is meant to make my work easier and less repetitive. I understood the concept of props and passing information from one component to another.
