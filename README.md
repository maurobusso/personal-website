HOW IS MADE

I developed the project using npm create-react-app on VS Code and a local server. This project holds a special place for me because I had been envisioning it since the very start of my coding journey. Building it from scratch marked a significant milestone in my learning journey. I aimed for a minimalist, well-designed, and highly functional website. While I found inspiration in dozens of portfolio websites, I consciously chose to keep things simple from the outset.

WHAT I LEARNT 

I learned that React is meant to make my work easier and less repetitive. I understood the concept of props and passing information from one component to another.
