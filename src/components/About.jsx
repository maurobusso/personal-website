          <p className="font-SpecialElite">""At the age of 13, I discovered my passion for coding while exploring my dad's computer. Despite the limited resources and a lack of learning materials in my native language, I began teaching myself Python. Although I faced initial challenges and setbacks, my love for technology never wavered. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          During my university years, I worked on a project using Wix to create a website that helped people with rehabilitation. It was then that I realized my deep affinity for web development. Motivated by this newfound passion, I dived into learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This marked the turning point in my career, as I decided to transition into software development. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Since then, I have embraced continuous learning, leveraging online resources and engaging with coding communities. Through perseverance and tackling challenging projects, I have sharpened my skills and grown as a developer.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I am now equipped with the knowledge and skills to contribute to the ever-evolving field of software development. I look forward to making a meaningful impact and collaborating with like-minded professionals in creating innovative solutions."
